My name is **Donglin Yang** (杨东霖). I am an MPhil student in the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at The University of Hong Kong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/), advised by [Prof. Xiaojuan Qi](https://xjqi.github.io/). I am currently an intern with the [KLING Team at Kuaishou Technology](https://klingai.com/cn/), where I work on joint optimization of training and sampling for flow-based generative models. My research interests broadly span machine learning and deep generative modeling.

**Previously**, I was a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia](https://ece.ubc.ca/), under the supervision of [Prof. Renjie Liao](https://lrjconan.github.io/), and earlier a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) during 2022–2023, advised by [Prof. Han Liu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/liu-han.html). I left both programs due to visa-related constraints.

I also interned at the [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) from 2023 to 2024, focusing on efficient image super-resolution. I received my B.Eng. in Electronic Information Science and Technology from the [Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in 2022, where I worked closely with [Prof. Yang Gao](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaoyang/yang-gao.weebly.com/index.html) on imitation learning.
